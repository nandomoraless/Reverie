                    Infini is about looking ahead. Taking care of your life off the grid and listening to Reverie’s best
                    and newest in electronic music.


                    Having begun life as an outlet for the deeper and more progressive end of the trio’s DJ sets,
                    Reverie has grown into one of the dance music world’s most respected imprints.

                    Over its 15 years and 300+ releases, the sound of the label has evolved, but while the BPMs may have
                    slowed, the mission statement of Reverie has remained the same - to release timeless soulful and
                    melodic electronic music.
